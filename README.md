# Homework 2

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.	Familiarize students with **linked lists**
2.  Familiarize students with **array storage** and **linked storage**.
3.  Practice **time complexity** analysis.

## Program
Add functionality for the incomplete data structure functions.  

Modify this README document with a paragraph (at least three complete sentences) explaining why the different storage methods are better for the different lists used in the driver.
# EXPLANATION GOES UNDER HERE 
Different storage methods work well in the driver based on how they're used. LinkedList works for todoList because it makes adding and removing tasks really easy and efficient since tasks change a lot. ArrayList on the other hand is perfect for doneList since tasks tasks are just added and they don't change a lot. Basically, linked lists for tasks that change a lot and arrays for tasks that stay the same for a efficient program.
## Submission details
If you are usinng git from the command line, execute the following commands:
1.	After accepting the assignment invitation, copy the clone URL
2.	Type 
```git clone clone URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands: 
```
git add .
git commit -m “your commit message”
git push
```
## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
